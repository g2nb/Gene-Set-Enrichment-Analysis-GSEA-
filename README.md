# Gene-Set-Enrichment-Analysis-GSEA-
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identifies gene sets that are upnregulated or downregulated between two conditions/phenotypes. The GSEA method can be summarized as:  Take gene expression data from two different types of samples (e.g., treated vs non-treated) and rank all genes according to their degree of differential expression between the phenotypes. Take a set of genes of interest (e.g., pathway, locus, etc.) and determine whether they are differentially expressed as a group (enriched) within the ranked gene expression data. Note: you can repeat this step for multiple gene sets 3. Determine the significance of the enrichment analysis score via a permutation test: randomly swap the gene-set labels of the data and repeat the test many times.
